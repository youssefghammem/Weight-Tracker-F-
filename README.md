Weight-Tracker

I Implement a weight tracker application as a WebSharper client-server application that allows users to:

Enter and store their weight on a given day.

Display all stored measurements as a Day/(Loss or Gain)/Weight table.

Display a line chart for all measurements (X-axis: date, Y-axis: weight).

Elaborate UI design
